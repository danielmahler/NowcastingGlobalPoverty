Files starting with:
00: Programs that will be called in subsequent .do-files
01: Takes some raw data and procceses them
02: Merges all input data and creates the final dataset used for predictions
03: Predicts the headcount/mean/median/gini using the various methods
04: Merges the predictions
05: Converts the predictions in the mean/median (and at times, gini) into headcount predictions
06: Merges the predictions from 04 with 05
07: Calculates errors
08: Produces main figures
09: Sample figures for paper unrelated to much of the rest of the code
The folder "Multiple imputation" contains separate scripts that multiply imputes the final input data.

Below is a more detailed description:

00.matrix_rename.do:
- A program that allows to change row and column names of matrices. This .do-file will be called in later .do-files

01a.CLASS.do
- Prepares the CLASS files

01b.WDI.do:
- Takes the WDI data and processes it, and keeps the relevant variables that we want to use for the analysis. 

01c.WEO.do:
- Takes the raw WEO data and processes it, and keeps the relevant variables that we want to use for the analysis. 

01d.NationalAccounts.do:
- Takes the national accounts file from another repository and keeps the relevant information.

01e.PovcalNet_fulldisttributions.do:
- Recovers the full distributions of all survey points

01f.PovcalNet_poverty.do:
- Generates the dataset of poverty estimates, weights, and samples.

01g.Population.do:
- Generates population data

01h.RemoteSensing.do
- Cleans the remote sensing data

01i.WEO_historcal.do
- Cleans the historical WEO GDP nowcasts and forecasts

02a.merge_data.do
- Merges all data files from 01.* .do-files

02b.merge_data_lag.do
- Merges all data files from 01.* .do-files while assuming that a missing value takes the lagged value

02c.Multiple_imputation.do
- Cleans the multiply imputed dataset generated in the scripts in the subfoldre "Multiple imputation"

03a.status_quo_national_accounts_and_perfect
- Generates status quo predictions, predictions from using other national accounts rules and 'perfect' mean predictions, i.e. predictions that are identical to the true values.

03b.CART.R:
- Makes predictions using CART random forests

03c.CIF.R:
- Makes predictions using conditional inference random forests

03d.CIFlag.R:
- Makes predictions using conditional inference random forests  assuming a missing value takes a lagged value

03e.XGBOOST.R
- Makes predictions using gradient boosting

03f.mi_lasso.do:
- Makes predictions using the lasso

03g.mi_lasso_postscript.do
- Cleans the output of the lasso predictions

03h.diagnostics.do
- Looks if the predictions and tuning grids from the other 03 files are reasonable

04a.merge_predictions_step1.do
- Merges all predictions from step 3

05a.predicted_headcount_two_parameter_distributions.do:
- Computes predicted headcounts for methods that use two-parameter distributional assumptions

05b.predicted_headcount_povcal.do:
- Computes predicted headcounts assuming distribution neutrality

05c.predicted_headcount_gic.do:
- Computes predicted headcount rates utiltizing growth incidence curves

06.merge_predictions_step1.do
- Takes direct predictions and merges them from the ones that have used distributional assumptions to get poverty predictions. It then cleans the final prediction data.

07.calculate_error.do:
- Takes all predictions and calucates errors

08a.PlotErrors_Collapsed.do
- Plots the summary error statistics by method

08b.PlotError_NonCollapsed
- Plots figures using non-collapsed errors.

08c.GlobalPoverty
- Calculates global/regional/country-level poverty using all method

08d.GlobalPovertyMap.R
- Produces the global poverty map

08e.GDPvintage.do
- Produces the figures using vintages of WEO growth forecasts/nowcasts

08f.OnlineAppendix.do
- Produces figures/tables for the online appendix

09a.SampleFiguresForPape
- Produces figures for the paper explaining how it works to predict the mean and the mean/Gini.
